# ðŸŒ± My Dotfiles

This is my personal **dotfiles** setup.  
I use **[GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)** to manage and symlink all my configs in a clean and modular way.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

First, install **GNU Stow**.  
It depends on your package manager. Since I use Arch Linux:

```bash
sudo pacman -S stow

```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SoeukBondol-ai/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
stow .
```
